# 14 Electrical use becomes indoor heat

**Status:** untested

**Claim:** Apart from the AC (which moves heat outside), essentially all electricity used inside becomes heat inside the house.

**Data:** Whole-house power (HA energy), any per-circuit sensors, temperatures.

**Method:**
- Add measured electrical power as an input term in the RC model and fit its coefficient (expect about 1 for indoor loads).
- Treat the AC and the oven as unmetered terms: derive AC load from its call state, and expect the oven to appear as residual.

**Caveats:** Some load is outside the envelope (e.g. outdoor, garage); room allocation of heat is unknown.

## Results

Furnace blower and the stove (`scripts/power_check.py`, whole-house power at about 30-second resolution, 10 days from 23 October 2026).

- The furnace blower is visible. Across 122 whole-house heating episodes of 8 minutes or more, power rose a median 0.25 kW when heating started and fell 0.26 kW when it stopped, against -0.04 and +0.01 kW at 122 control times with no heating. So about 250 W of electrical draw goes with a furnace run, small beside the 1.1 kW base load.
- Larger events are far more obvious, as expected: 41 bursts lasting 10 minutes or more and at least 1 kW above the surrounding baseline, the biggest about 30-65 minutes at +2 to +2.5 kW on average (peaks of 3-4 kW), roughly ten times the blower step. They cluster around 12:00-15:00 and 17:00, with a few late evening. Without ground truth we cannot say which appliance each is (an oven or stove, a dryer, a dishwasher and the 3D printers are all candidates). The first regression found no electricity-to-room-heat effect (coefficients near zero), because 30-minute whole-house power is a poor proxy for heat landing in any one room.
